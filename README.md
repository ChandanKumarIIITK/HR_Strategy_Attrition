# HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition data to gain valuable insights into workforce trends, identify key factors influencing attrition, and provide data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention. Using Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard that visualizes attrition metrics by job roles, education fields, age groups, salary slabs, and years in the company.

## Data Used

## Power BI Questions: 
1. What is the total number of employees, attrition count, and attrition percentage?
2. How does attrition vary by job role, education field, and age group?
3. Which salary slabs have the highest attrition rates?
4. What is the distribution of attrition across different years in the company?
5. What are the trends in attrition based on department and gender?
6. What are the key insights that can help HR optimize retention strategies?

## Process of the Project: 
Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning
1. Gathered HR attrition data from a CSV file.
2. Cleaned and pre-processed the data using Power Query (removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized columns).
Step 2: Data Modeling & Transformation
1. Structured the dataset to establish relationships between key attributes.
2. Created new calculated columns and transformed data for better analysis.
Step 3: DAX Measures Development
1. Developed DAX measures for key performance indicators, including: Total Employees,Total Attrition Count,Attrition Percentage,Average Employee AgeAverage Years in the Company,Attrition by Job Role, Education Field, Age Group, and Salary Slab,
Step 4: Power BI Dashboard Development
1. Designed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with:
2. KPI cards displaying total employees, attrition count, and attrition percentage.
3. Line charts to show attrition trends over time.Bar and pie charts to represent job role-wise and education field-wise attrition.
4. Filters and slicers to drill down into specific insights by department and gender.



## Project Insights:
1. Job Role Attrition:The highest attrition is observed among Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.Research Scientists and Sales Representatives also show significant attrition.
2. Age Group Analysis:Employees aged 26-35 have the highest attrition rates.Younger employees (18-25) and mid-career professionals (36-45) also show notable attrition.
3. Education Field Contribution:Employees with backgrounds in Marketing and Life Sciences have higher attrition rates.
4. Salary Influence on Attrition:Employees in the Up to 5K salary slab exhibit the highest attrition.Higher salary brackets (10K-15K and above) have significantly lower attrition.
5. Work Tenure Impact:Employees with 1-3 years in the company tend to leave the most.Long-term employees (10+ years) have much lower attrition rates.

## Learning Experience
1. ✔ Improved data cleaning and transformation skills using Power Query.
2. ✔ Strengthened understanding of DAX measures for advanced calculations.
3. ✔ Gained expertise in designing interactive Power BI dashboards.
4. ✔ Developed actionable business insights to enhance HR decision-making.
   
## Project Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged for workforce analytics to gain meaningful insights into employee attrition. The interactive dashboard provides HR professionals with valuable data to identify attrition trends, improve retention strategies, and make data-driven decisions for workforce planning.
